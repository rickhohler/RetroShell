# Template Directory

This directory contains documentation and resources related to **maintaining and developing the template itself**, not for projects created from the template.

## Purpose

This directory is for template maintainers and developers. It contains:
- Template development guidelines
- Template maintenance documentation
- AI agent guidelines for template development
- Template setup instructions
- Template development notes and decisions

## Contents

- `AGENT.md` - Guidelines for AI coding assistants working on template development
- `GITHUB_TEMPLATE_SETUP.md` - Instructions for setting up this repository as a GitHub template
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Template development notes and decisions (if needed)

## Important Note

**This directory is NOT included in projects created from the template.** Files in this directory are only relevant to the template repository itself.

For project-specific documentation, use the `docs/` directory in your shell project.

## Template vs Project Files

- **Template files** (this directory): About the template itself
- **Project files** (`docs/`, `ai/`, `notes/`): For projects created from the template
