# Documentation

This directory contains **private project documentation** for your shell project. This is for documentation about your actual project, not about the template itself.

> **Note:** Template-specific documentation (for maintaining the template) is in the `template/` directory, which is not included in projects created from the template.

## What goes here?

- Project planning documents
- Internal design decisions
- Meeting notes
- Architecture diagrams
- API documentation drafts
- Any other documentation that should remain private

## Organization

Consider organizing by:
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Topic/feature
- Type (design, planning, etc.)
