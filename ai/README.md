# AI Documents

This directory contains **ALL AI-generated content, prompts, and conversations related to the project (submodule)**.

**Critical Rule:** ALL AI documentation about the project MUST be stored here in the shell project, NEVER in the project submodule itself.

## What goes here?

- **ALL AI conversation logs** about the project code
- **ALL prompt templates** used for the project
- **ALL AI-generated documentation** for the project
- **ALL code generation outputs** from AI tools
- **ALL AI-assisted design decisions** for the project
- **Any other AI-related materials** about the project

**Remember:** If it's AI-related and about the project (submodule), it belongs here, not in the project submodule.

## Organization

Consider organizing by:
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- AI tool/service (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Topic or feature
- Type (prompts, outputs, etc.)
